## 🚀 Why smart-env?

Environment variables are critical — but `.env` files are easy to mess up.

- Missing keys cause silent runtime errors.  
- Values are often the wrong type (e.g., `"true"` instead of `true`).  
- Secrets can leak accidentally.  
- No type safety in TypeScript.

`smart-env` fixes that with:
- ✅ **Schema validation**
- ⚡ **TypeScript type generation**
- 🔐 **Optional encryption**
- 🧠 **Developer-friendly CLI**
